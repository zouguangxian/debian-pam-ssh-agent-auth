Comment:
 This directory is largely identical with what is found in openssh, with just
 names changed to avoid collisions. This section credits the creators and
 mentions the licenses in batch (assisted by the licensecheck utility), but if
 you need more information, see the openssh package or the individual files'
 copyright statements.

Files: OPENSSH_LICENSE
License: BSD-2-clause
Copyright: Markus Friedl
Comment:
 The file states that it is part of OpenSSH, and (in 6) that the remaining
 components are BSD-licensed.
 .
 It seems that this license is not referenced anywhere in the code outside the
 build process itself, so the license does not get shipped with the binaries.
